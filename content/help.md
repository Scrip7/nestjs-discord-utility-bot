To help us help you, when asking for help, tell us the following:
- **Expectations!** What did you expect your code to do? What did it actually do?
- **Errors!** If your code produced an error, paste the error message for us to see!
- **Code!** We can't help you if you don't show us the code that you're having trouble with. No screenshots -- use code blocks instead please.
- **Libraries!** If you're using a library, tell us the library name.
