__**Video Tutorial Pros vs Cons**__
For the sake of learning (and/or) asking for help,
it is advised NOT to use videos for programming.

**Pros:**
• More persuasive/Enjoyable compared to text.
• Easier visual demonstrations for installations.
• Good form of showcasing Tools/Software

**Cons:**
• Incorrect/Misleading practices can be taught.
• Sources might be Outdated, such as: 
   – Libraries/Dependencies used
   – Language Version itself or Practices within it
   – Editors or IDEs (or any Obsolete program)
• Saving progress requires tracking timestamps.
• Frequent rewinding, if they go too fast.
• Finding Subtopics requires time-skipping.
• Trial/Limited videos can leave you hanging.
• Harder to share code-segments.
