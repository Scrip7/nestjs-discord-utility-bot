> Please don't just say "Hello"/"Hi" in chat when you have a question

> You're trying to be polite by not jumping right into the request, like you would do in person or on the phone. But chat is neither of those things. Typing is much slower than talking. Instead of being polite, you are just making the other person wait for you to phrase your question.
