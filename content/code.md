Give me your code! It will be easier for the both of us, and will make debugging way easier. 
**Please use** https://privatebin.net/, https://gist.github.com/, **or** https://hatebin.com/.
If you're sending HTML, CSS, or JS, you may find https://codepen.io/, https://jsfiddle.net/, or https://jsbin.com/ easier.
If your code is small, you can send it on discord with codeblocks (?tag codeblocks).
Please **do not send me a screenshot or text file** of your code.
If you have a bug in your code **please provide the traceback**.
